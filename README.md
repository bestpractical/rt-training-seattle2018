This is a repo for code we might create for the RT training in Seattle.

# To Do

- [ ] Add custom lifecycle and custom status with scrip to set custom date

- [ ] Add column map for links to transactions

- [ ] Create scrip to add group manager as a watcher for any ticket that the group is involved in.

- [ ] Go to jumbo instead of display on ticket

- [ ] Create scrip to see if owner has email delivery set to "suspended" and if so send
   autoreply saying "I am out of the office".
- [ ] Scrip when a user is added to a group give them some rights

- [ ] How to build saved searches for situations where information is missing or absent

# Bugs?

* When a unpriv user does not have the comment right they can still
   see the "comment" transaction option. When they click it, it appears that they will
   comment but really it ends up being a reply.

* Saved searches for a group do not show up under Available dashboards

* Modifying time format
